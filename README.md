Simple Python projects – Dungeon Fight and Bank Terminal

## Python Practice Projects – Gabrion-AI

This repository contains two beginner-friendly Python projects created as part of my learning journey. These small terminal-based games helped me improve my understanding of programming fundamentals such as input/output, loops, conditions, functions, file handling, and working with GitHub.

### 🔧 Features:
- Turn-based combat
- Random damage using `random.randint()`

## 🏦 2. Bank Terminal

A basic simulation of a banking terminal system in the command line. Users log in and can check their balance, deposit, or withdraw money.

## 📌 Purpose

These projects are part of my preparation for a junior position in IT. I'm currently self-learning Python and GitHub, and using small practical projects like these to improve my problem-solving and programming skills.
